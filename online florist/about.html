        We are fresh plants and flower sellers.we choose different
        vendors from different areas with wide variety of plants
        and flowers, sell them through our website and delivering
        the product to the customers at their door step. Experts
        believe that the production focus has moved from traditional
        growers to countries where the climates are better an
        production and labor costs are lower. This has resulted in
        a paradigm shift in the floral industry. The Netherlands,
        for instance, has already shifted attention from flower
        production to flower trading, though it plays an important
        role still in the development of floricultural genetics.
        The new centers of production are typically developing
        countries like Ecuador (The Biggest producer and export of
        roses worldwide), Colombia (second largest exporter in the
        world and with a market of more than 40 years old), Ethiopia,
        Kenya, and India. Other players in this global industry are
        Mexico, Israel, South Africa, Australia, Thailand and Malaysia.
        New Zealand, due to its position in the Southern Hemisphere,
        is a common source for seasonal flowers that are typically
        unavailable in Europe and the United States.


              In Africa,Kenya is the largest exporter,
                   supplying a large percentage of
                           Europe's flowers.</pre>
